   file name: okhttp-3.11.0.jar
   ** DISPUTED ** CertificatePinner.java in OkHttp 3.x through 3.12.0 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass certificate pinning by changing SSLContext and the boolean values while hooking the application. NOTE: This id is disputed because some parties don't consider this is a vulnerability. Their rationale can be found in https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/4967.
